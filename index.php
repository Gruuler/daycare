							We aim to provide high quality child care by maintaining a smaller class. 
							Although we are licensed to have 16 children with two care providers, we believe a smaller class allows for more one-on-one interaction and teaching time. 
							To ensure we meet the highest quality, our staff is continually enrolled in trainings to be better prepared to meet each child's individual needs, such as disabilities or personality traits. 
							To maintain a safe and responsive environment staff is required to be CPR and First Aid Certified and hold a Food Handler's permit.

						<p>
							Our outdoor area allows children lots of space for running and interaction. 
							The play area has grass for play structures, and a cement area for motor activities like basketball and riding tricycles.  
							There is plenty of space to encourage children to use their imaginations though dancing, playing, and crafts.
